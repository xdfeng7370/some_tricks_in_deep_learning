# some_tricks_in_deep_learning
I reproduce three numerical experiments. The first example depicts the symmetric structure in neural network; the second example shows the adaptive activation function, namely, $\sigma(x)\to \sigma(ax)$, where $a$ is a learnable parameter. The last example shows the spectral bias in the DNN.
